This tool enables the user to establish a succesfull connection with the Alveo CMS IP. Which is an IP dedicated to extract data from the embedded processor which monitors the FPGA. This tool is independent from the type of driver and DMA controller used (QDMA or XDMA). The user can create their own platform without much modifications needed.
